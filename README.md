# SCT_ML_1
 House price prediction using Advanced Regression Techniques. This project predicts the price of the house on key features such as square footage and number of bedrooms. This is implemented using Python and trained on Kaggle dataset to make accurate prediction.

# Project Structure
## * Data Preprocessing:
  - Handling missing values
  - Feature scaling and normalization
## * Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable
## * Model Building:
  - Linear Regression using scikit-learn
  - Train-Test split to evaluate model performance
## * Model Evaluation:
  - Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE)
## * Prediction
  - Using the trained model to predict house price
